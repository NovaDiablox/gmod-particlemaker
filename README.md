# Particle Maker

This is the Git repository for Particle Maker. The plugin that can create particles as you please.

## What does it do

The addon does the following, as stated in the old (removed) addon.txt file:

> Particle Maker is a STOOL capable of creating user-defined particles.
>
> You can create your own particles, set their color, size, sprite, gravity,
> motion and much more.  This stool is a modification of Robbis_1's Particle
> Maker to make it work with the new Garry's Mod code.
>
> Robbis_1 created the base code, I added a lot of tweaks and made it gmod 13
> compatible.  If you find any bugs (or if any future update causes them), post
> them on my Steam profile or mail them to roelof@tmg-clan.com.
>
> Have fun with it.

Note that the mentioned e-mail is no longer being used, as the associated clan
has since been disbanded. Any issues can be reported using this repository.

More information can be found on the [Workshop page][workshop].

## Is it still actively being maintained?

No, the application hasn't been updated in ages and throws errors all over the place if used incorrectly. However, since the addon has been interfering with [Wiremod][wiremod], I've decided to update it and put the changes on Github, as to please the Wiremod overlords.

# License

The previous version had no licensing information whatsoever, this new version is licensed under the [Apache license v2][license].

# Can I help?

Sure, open an issue and tell me what you want to do, optionally join it with a merge request and I'll see what I can do (if it's cool, I'll put it on the Workshop).
