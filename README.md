# Particle Maker

This is the Git repository for Particle Maker. The plugin that can create
particles as you please.

## What does it do

The addon does the following, as stated in the old (removed) addon.txt file:

> Particle Maker is a STOOL capable of creating user-defined particles.
>
> You can create your own particles, set their color, size, sprite, gravity,
> motion and much more.  This stool is a modification of Robbis_1's Particle
> Maker to make it work with the new Garry's Mod code.
>
> Robbis_1 created the base code, I added a lot of tweaks and made it gmod 13
> compatible.  If you find any bugs (or if any future update causes them), post
> them on my Steam profile or mail them to roelof@tmg-clan.com.
>
> Have fun with it.

Note that the mentioned e-mail is no longer being used, as the associated clan
has since been disbanded. Any issues can be reported using this repository.

More information can be found on the [Workshop page][workshop].

## Is it still actively being maintained?

No, the application hasn't been updated in ages and throws errors all over the
place if used incorrectly. However, since the addon has been interfering with
[Wiremod][wiremod], I've decided to update it and put the changes on Github, as
to please the Wiremod overlords.
