# Particle Maker

This is the Git repository for Particle Maker. The plugin that can create
particles as you please.

## What does it do

The Particle Maker is a scripted tool for Garry's Mod that can create
user-defined particles.

The addon has support for [Wiremod][wiremod] and can be controlled by the
keyboard (using old-school keybindings) and/or via Wiremod inputs.

You can create your own particles, set their color, size, sprite, gravity,
motion and much more.  This stool is a modification of [Robbis_1][robbis1]'s
Particle Maker to make it work with the new Garry's Mod code.

The code since has had a major overhaul and is now multi-lingual and has a
better, more intuitive interface, where the complexity increases the further
your scroll downward in the settings.

More information, as well as user questions and discussions can be found on
[Particle Maker's Workshop page][workshop]. Any code-related bugs and feature
requests can be placed here using Githubs ticket system.

## Is it still actively being maintained?

Not really, there are no new features on track so it's just bug fixing. New
features might be added in the future.

# License

The previous version had no licensing information whatsoever, this new version
is licensed under the [Apache license v2][license].
