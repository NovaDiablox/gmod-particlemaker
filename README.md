# Particle Maker

This is the Git repository for Particle Maker. The plugin that can create particles as you please.

## Is it still actively being maintained?

No, the application hasn't been updated in ages and throws errors all over the place if used incorrectly. However, since the addon has been interfering with [Wiremod](https://github.com/wiremod/wire), I've decided to update it and put the changes on Github, as to please the Wiremod overlords.

# License

The previous version had no licensing information whatsoever, this new version is licensed under the [Apache license v2](LICENSE).

# Can I help?

Sure, open an issue and tell me what you want to do, optionally join it with a merge request and I'll see what I can do (if it's cool, I'll put it on the Workshop).

## Anything else?

Ehh, no.

# This readme is crap

I know, I don't really care since the project is practically dead.
